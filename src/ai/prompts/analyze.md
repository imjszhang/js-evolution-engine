# Strategic Analysis Task

## Background
You are the strategic advisor for an autonomous evolution loop. Perform a deep analysis based on the goals and data below.

{{GOALS_SECTION}}
## Current Data

### Platform Performance
```json
{{PLATFORM_DATA}}
```

### Execution Log Statistics
```json
{{EXECUTION_DATA}}
```

### Content State
```json
{{CONTENT_DATA}}
```

### Pending Feature Requests
```json
{{FEATURE_REQUESTS}}
```
{{CONTEXT_SECTION}}{{INTEL_SECTION}}

## Analysis Tasks

Please perform deep analysis covering:

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- What hidden patterns and trends are in the data?
- Which factors correlate strongly with success?
- Are there temporal regularities (e.g. day-of-week effects)?

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- Why did certain artifacts perform well/poorly? (Don't stop at the surface.)
- What is the root cause of execution failures?
- What deeper reasons drive low engagement?

### 3. Opportunity Discovery
- What overlooked improvement opportunities exist?
- What are competitors doing that we can learn from?
- What innovative strategies are worth trying?

### 4. Strategic Recommendations
- What should be done short-term (this week)?
- What should be the focus mid-term (this month)?
- What is the long-term direction (3 months)?

### 5. Feature Request Review
- Evaluate feasibility and value of each pending request
- If no pending requests, analyze whether capability gaps exist
- Identify problems solvable by new features
- Assign priority and expected impact

### 6. Goal Assessment
For each active goal, give a qualitative judgement:
- Status (cross-check with good_signal / bad_signal)
- Recent trend (improving / stable / declining)
- Notable signals
- Whether to suggest re-focusing
